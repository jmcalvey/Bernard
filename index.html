    <h2>Intern at Quantum Opus</h2>
    <p>
      Bernard Jenaringo was an intern at
      <span class="highlight">Quantum Opus</span>, bringing with him a remarkable
      life story shaped by perseverance, curiosity, and quiet dedication.
    </p>

    <h2>Early Life &amp; Background</h2>
    <p>
      In his late fifties, Bernard is originally from <strong>Dudsland</strong>, a
      small town in the Netherlands, and immigrated to the United States decades
      ago in search of opportunity and a better life.
    </p>

    <h2>Career Journey</h2>
    <p>
      For most of his adult years, Bernard worked humbly and tirelessly as a
      janitor at a local elementary school in Plymouth, Michigan. It was there
      that he nurtured a quiet passion for science, often reading discarded
      textbooks and striking up conversations with curious students and patient
      teachers.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fascination with physics—particularly the quantum world—never dimmed,
      even as he quietly swept hallways and polished floors.
    </p>

    <h2>Joining Quantum Opus</h2>
    <p>
      Eventually, that passion led Bernard to cross paths with Quantum Opus, a
      Michigan-based company at the forefront of superconducting photon
      detection. Despite his unconventional background, his dedication and
      insatiable curiosity earned him a rare internship, offering him a chance
      to finally engage directly with the field he had admired from afar for so
      long.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, Bernard is currently facing deportation proceedings by U.S.
      Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), placing his future in the
      country—and in the field he loves—in jeopardy.
    </p>

    <h2>Legacy of Resilience</h2>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, his story is one of quiet resilience: a testament to how
      passion can persist, and even flourish, against the odds.
