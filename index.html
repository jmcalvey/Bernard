    <h1>Bernard "Sam" Jenaringo</h1>
    <h2>Intern at Quantum Opus</h2>
    <p>Bernard Jenaringo was an intern at <span class="highlight">Quantum Opus</span>, bringing with him a remarkable life story shaped by perseverance, curiosity, and quiet dedication.</p>

    <h2>Early Life & Background</h2>
    <p>In his late fifties, Bernard is originally from <strong>Dudsland</strong>, a small town in the Netherlands, and immigrated to the United States decades ago in search of opportunity and a better life.</p>

    <h2>Career Journey</h2>
    <p>For most of his adult years, Bernard worked humbly and tirelessly as a janitor at a local elementary school in Plymouth, Michigan. It was there that he nurtured a quiet passion for science, often reading discarded textbooks and striking up conversations with curious students and patient teachers.</p>
    <p>His fascination with physics—particularly the quantum world—never dimmed, even as he quietly swept hallways and polished floors.</p>

    <h2>Joining Quantum Opus</h2>
    <p>Eventually, that passion led Bernard to cross paths with Quantum Opus, a Michigan-based company at the forefront of superconducting photon detection. Despite his unconventional background, his dedication and insatiable curiosity earned him a rare internship, offering him a chance to finally engage directly with the field he had admired from afar for so long.</p>

    <h2>Current Challenges</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, Bernard is currently facing deportation proceedings by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), placing his future in the country—and in the field he loves—in jeopardy.</p>

    <h2>Legacy of Resilience</h2>
    <p>Nevertheless, his story is one of quiet resilience: a testament to how passion can persist, and even flourish, against the odds.</p>
